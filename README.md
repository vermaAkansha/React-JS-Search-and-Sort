This is a working example of searching and sorting some products stored in local json to show on screen based on user interaction such as:-
a. Filter/search a specific product - by typing the product to be searched in the search bar
b. Show products which are in stock - by clicking the "Show stocked products" checkbox

By default, the app shows all the products with products that are not in stock highlighted as red.
